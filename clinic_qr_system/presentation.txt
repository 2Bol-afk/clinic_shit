Introduction
- Why it matters: Prevents missed doses, improves adherence, supports public health.
- Pain points addressed: Lost paper records, duplicate entries, unclear schedules, delayed reminders.
- Objectives: Automation, accuracy, patient safety, and actionable reporting.

Goals
- Automation: Automatic reminders and instant updates on action.
- Accuracy: Single source of truth for dose plans and administration dates.
- Safety: Guardrails to avoid duplicate vaccine selection and maintain privacy.

---
Roles & Permissions
- Patient
  - View: personal vaccination history, upcoming doses, reminders.
  - No edits to clinical records.
- Doctor
  - Prescribe vaccine types; set/adjust schedules; clinical notes.
- Vaccination Staff
  - Administer vaccines; update dose status and dates; manage boosters.
- Pharmacy
  - Validate vaccine dispensing for audits and reconciliations.
- Admin
  - Full access to vaccination reports, configuration, and data maintenance.

Access Control
- Authentication: Django login; protected dashboard routes.
- Authorization: Role-based visibility within module pages and reports.

---
Data Model Overview (Conceptual)
- VaccineType
  - Canonical vaccine definitions (e.g., COVID-19, Hepatitis B).
- Patient
  - Demographics; profile photo; authentication linkage.
- PatientVaccination
  - One record per patient per vaccine type; properties: administered_count, last_administered_date.
- VaccineDose
  - Child of PatientVaccination; fields: dose_number (1/2/3/booster), planned_date, administered (bool), administered_date.
- VaccinationRecord (visit-bound)
  - JSON details of the working plan; status: In Process / Done / Not Done; synchronization to PatientVaccination/VaccineDose.
- VaccinationReminder
  - Email reminders tied to scheduled doses where applicable.
- Visit, LabResult, Prescription (integration context)
  - Cross-module reporting and dashboards.

---
Key Functionalities
- Dynamic Dose Planning Form
  - Checkboxes and date pickers for 1st, 2nd, 3rd dose and optional booster.
  - Always-visible date pickers for Dose 2/3 even if unchecked (planning-first UX).
- Auto-Save on Change
  - No Save button; fields persist via AJAX in real-time.
  - Robust hydration from server JSON or local cache if needed.
- Mark as Done / Mark as Not Done
  - Not Done: preserve all data, send immediate email with dose schedule details.
  - Done: finalize record; close open same-day tickets for Vaccination.
- Booster Controls
  - Add booster when needed; Remove Booster to undo accidental selection.
- Duplicate Vaccine Prevention
  - Vaccine types already assigned to a patient are hidden or disabled in dropdowns.
- Email Notifications
  - Immediate email reminder upon Not Done for Dose 2/3/Booster, including vaccine name and dates.

---
End-to-End Workflows
1) Planning
  - Doctor or Vaccination Staff selects vaccine type and sets dose dates.
  - Auto-save persists details; duplicate vaccine types are prevented.
2) Patient Notification
  - If marked Not Done, patient receives immediate email summarizing scheduled Dose 2/3/Booster dates and vaccine name.
3) Administration
  - Staff checks administered dose(s); system marks VaccineDose.administered = true with administered_date.
  - Status can remain Not Done if future doses remain, while preserving recorded doses.
4) Completion
  - Mark as Done when all planned doses are completed for the visit; same-day vaccination tickets are closed.
5) Reporting
  - Reports reflect administered_count (e.g., 1/2) and last_administered_date; booster shown conditionally when applicable.

Edge Behaviors
- Dose 2/3 date pickers visible even if unchecked, enabling schedule-first planning.
- Booster date can be selected without first checking; remove booster hides it again.
- Not Done never clears previous entries; the form reloads with sticky values.

---
Patient Experience (Portal)
- Latest Updates widget shows the next dose due and pending lab items.
- Current Prescriptions displays structured prescriptions or recent doctor notes when structures are absent.
- Vaccination history shows dose counts like “1/2” and last administered date.

---
Staff Experience (Clinic Dashboard)
- Vaccination Work Page
  - Fluid, autosaving form; no explicit save required.
  - Clear statuses; immediate email on Not Done; duplication prevention.
- Laboratory
  - Claiming updates the UI list via AJAX; no manual refresh needed.
- Pharmacy
  - Validates dispensing; admin reports reconcile doctor consultations and prescriptions.

---
Reports & Analytics
- Role-Based Access
  - Admin: system-wide, time-bounded reports.
  - Vaccination Staff: operational vaccination report views for daily work.
  - Patient: self-only vaccination report.
- Dose-Based Layout
  - Columns for 1st, 2nd, 3rd doses; conditional Booster column when present.
- Simplified Columns
  - Removed “Given On” and “Certificate” fields to reduce clutter.
- Filters
  - By dose (1st/2nd/3rd/booster) and by vaccine type.
- Accuracy Enhancements
  - Administered counts and last administered date computed from PatientVaccination/VaccineDose.

---
Email & Communications
- Immediate reminder email upon Not Done for planned Dose 2/3/Booster.
- Messaging includes patient-friendly wording and vaccine names.
- Fault-tolerant sending: try/except guards for external email backend issues.

---
Admin & Background Jobs
- System Accounts
  - One-click creation of doctors per department and a reception account; passwords set to department names; credentials exported to details.txt.
- Database Maintenance
  - Purge command to delete all data except admin superusers (no backup), for testing or reseeding.
- Vaccination Reminders (optional scheduling)
  - Management command scaffold to send due reminders on schedule; currently immediate-send on Not Done is primary flow.

---
Security, Validation, Error Handling
- Authentication & Authorization
  - Django session auth; role-based access checks on views.
- Data Validation
  - Server-side validation of JSON details; only overwrite if valid and non-empty.
- Error Handling
  - Robust try/except around external email services; conservative persistence if JSON invalid.
- Privacy
  - Patients see only their own vaccination data and reminders.

---
Performance & Reliability
- Auto-save minimizes data loss risk and avoids long forms with explicit saves.
- Local hydration fallback reduces perceived latency and protects against transient errors.
- Atomic transactions for multi-step saves ensure consistency.

---
Benefits
- Improves patient compliance via timely reminders and clear schedules.
- Reduces errors: blocks duplicates, preserves data on Not Done, simplifies reporting.
- Enforces privacy with least-privilege access by role.
- Provides clean, dose-oriented reports for clinical and managerial insights.

---
Roadmap (Next Steps)
- SMS reminders and WhatsApp integration for higher engagement.
- Analytics dashboard: cohort adherence, dose completion rates, lag analysis.
- Bulk scheduling and outreach for campaigns.
- FHIR/HL7 interoperability for public health reporting.
- Mobile-friendly UI refinements; multilingual templates.
